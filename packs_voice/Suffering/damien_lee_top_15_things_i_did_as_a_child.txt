Number 15: Sewer Rats. When I was a young boy, I came across a couple of sewer rats from the drain beside my home.
I did what any young boy would do, and started eating the sewer rats, fur and all. My meemaw saw me in the corner,
devouring a couple of magnificent sewer rats. She exclaimed “¡Oh Dios mio! Mi poor boy. He’s eating sewer rats: rats that are
from the sewer. I did not reply, for I was crunching on a couple of sewer rats.
