The very memory of my face will cause a manifestation of my being in the future. You will be asleep in bed.
I will be there, and watch over you. When you wake, you will not be able to move any part of you.
When the doctors eventually find you, they will not see me, but you will, and I'll see you too, forever. I'll see you.
