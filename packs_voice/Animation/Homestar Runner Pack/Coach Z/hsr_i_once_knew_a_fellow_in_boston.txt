"Ya know, I once knew a fellow in Boston 'could tell ya the time of the day at any time of the day. Ya'd say,
'Say there Boston, what's the time of day?' And he'd say, '10:30.' And you'd look at him and say,
'But Boston, it's half past noon!' And he'd look back at ya and say, 'Well, those are the breaks.'"
